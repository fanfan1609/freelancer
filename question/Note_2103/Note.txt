Hi Henrik, please read note before checking.

1. Please use survey.sql in this folder for update database.

2. Please check in config.php line 4
define("URL","http://workspace.local/freelancer/question");
Please change http://workspace.local/freelancer/question to your url of survey. 

3. Currently I have problem when calling ajax to Otto form (Cross-domain). So I think this problem will be resovled when you upload to your server which have same domain which Otto form.
