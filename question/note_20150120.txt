1) You wanted me now to propose the looks for the final page, right?
============My answer=============
Yes, I think depends on user's point, final page will be diffirent. And I think it relate to your business.
==================================

2) At one question it starts with RANK, but it's a radio-button answer possibilities, do you have a suggestion of how to do that? Make it 3 questions instead, like nr 1, 2, 3?
========= My answer ===============
If you want this question have multi answers, please use sql below update in your database.
	UPDATE `questions` SET `type` = 'checkbox' WHERE `questions`.`id` =9;
==================================


3) I now chose to SKIP the last part, but it didn't skip it?
========= My answer ===============
The last question has default answer is A: Agriculture, forestry and fishing. So if you don't select , it still has answer.
If you want, I will add empty answer, then you must select if you want submit .
===================================


4) When I enter my e-mail, it seems to write to Otto allright, although it seems to start to write to custom_1 rather than custom_12 (which happens to be the first place available)
========= My answer ===============
Sorry for misunderstanding here, I understood that custom start from custom_1. It means it will from custom_12, is it right ?
I will update now. Regards.
===================================


5) How do I redirect the user from Otto to the showresult page (and will the resultpage use the custom-fields used by Otto to again interpret it back to which answer it really corresponds, to?
========= My answer ===============
Please give me Otto data (or workflow), then I will investigate the implement. Currently I don't know Otto'data structure, so I can not find out solution.
===================================


6) Did you have an idea on how to show an answer already in-line with the question itself? Perhaps overlaid the question or something? The answer itself can of course be the same answer as is found on the results page.
========= My answer ===============
Your questions are often selection questions. User can select one or more answer for each question.
I don't know your idea clearly.
Can you tell more detail about your thinking ? Or draw it Or write it as prototype 
===================================

7) If I skip answering any question, it doesn't ask me to fill in an answer? (On some of them with radio-buttons, we may be able to have a default choice being CHECKED, in that case, how should I specify that? Or we just skip it and the user themselves will have to choose one as long as there's a reminder to actually at least check one alternative?
========= My answer ===============
About asking when not fill in an answer,  it's my error and I have fixed and will send you index file later. 
About default checked value for radio-options, if you want , I will implement, it's so easy.
===================================
