+ type : there are some types as checkbox(multiple answers), radio(one answers), text( user input answer ), select (choose answer from select box)
+ note : some note for question

* Answers : contains 4 fields
+ content : answer content
+ question_id : id of question
+ point : point of answer
+ is_deleted : 1 if answer has been deleted, 0 if answer still available. Default is 0

* Users : contain 2 field

======== Your reply ==================
Hi, yeah, it's true that for multiple choices, attributing values could be one per choice, whereas in the text-input it's likely points attributed to it if it's an integer value above or below a certain threshold. Since I realize it may not be working to attribute more points for the different values, perhaps also multiple choice should be treated in the same way, ie having an if-statement after the input to be able to say that if one of the boxes was checked, THEN attribute this point to the queation.
========================================
With multiples choice, I will calculate point by summary point of all selected answers.
Example:
If question 1 has 5 answers and can have multiple choice, and assume user choose answer 1,2,4; so point of question 1 is summary point of answer 1,2,4.

With text input, I will do like as your suggestion, ie use a certain value to determine question's point.

============ Your reply=================
A question actually came up, too: if applicable per the actual question, it wouldn't be bad to be able to show an answer directly after a response has been entered, a bit like:
"Ok, since your answer indicate that you use Salesforce, you should know that XYZ..."

How doable is that?
========================================
I think you can add them in note field of question like as help block description.
